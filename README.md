# ![icon](https://github.com/IsolatedRainbow/BlueMageHelper/blob/master/icon.png) Blue Mage Helper - Endwalker

A Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV. Forked from the original Blue Mage Helper by Daemitus, found on [this page](https://github.com/markjsosnowski/BlueMageHelper). As such, I've done my best to maintain the original code from the creator, but changed necessary items.

This repository is for development! If you just want to use this addon, you'll need to install the [FFXIV Quick Launcher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) and read the 
[FAQ](https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/dalamud_troubleshooting.html#q-how-do-i-installenable-plugins).

Post-6.x: Blue Mage Helper was forked by Isolraine and updated to accomodate the new API Level for Dalamud. As such, please report any and all bugs that you find through the GitHub Page. https://github.com/IsolatedRainbow/BlueMageHelper
Pre-6.x: Blue Mage Helper is currently pending availability as a testing plugin. See [this page](https://markjsosnowski.github.io/FFXIV/) for pre-testing builds. 

## Features 
This plugin expands the information provided by the Blue Mage Spellbook's "Where to Learn" section for each spell, telling which monster you'll have to defeat, its level, and its coordinates if it can be 
found in the open world.

### Planned Features (From Previous Developer)
- Alternate locations and monsters
- Marking enemies with unlockable spells 
- Clickable locations to mark them on the world map
